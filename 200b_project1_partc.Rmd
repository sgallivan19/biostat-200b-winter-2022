Preliminary analyses 

BMI is significant between the two groups at p < .1 level. 

Now, I am going to check if there is a significant difference between the evaluable group and the non-evaluable group means for baseline variables. 
```{r}
df1 <- df %>% 
  select(income3, fsi2) %>%
  mutate(fsi2inc = ifelse(is.na(income3), NA, fsi2)) %>% 
  mutate(fsi2noinc = ifelse(is.na(income3), fsi2, NA))

t.test(df1$fsi2inc, df1$fsi2noinc)
```
The results are not significant. We cannot reject that the difference in means between the two groups is zero.
