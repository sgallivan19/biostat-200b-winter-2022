Preliminary analyses 

BMI is significant between the two groups at p < .1 level. 

Now, I am going to check if there is a significant difference between the evaluable group and the non-evaluable group means for baseline variables. 

*Create indicator variable for whether or not FSI2 data is missing for that patient*
```{r}
df1 <- df %>% 
  mutate(fsi2missing = ifelse(is.na(fsi2), TRUE, FALSE))
```
