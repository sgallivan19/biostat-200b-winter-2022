1. For the regression of logdocper on logpopdens bedp1000 hsgrad poverty unemp pcinck,
provide an interpretation of each of the regression coefficients.

* $\hat\beta_{0}$ = 2.98003. Intercept of the line. The expected value of “logdocper” when all independent variables in the model are equal to zero. 
* $\hat\beta_{1}$ = 0.04832. The percent increase of “docper” for a one percent increase in “popdens”, controlling for the other variables in the model. 
* $\hat\beta_{2}$ = 0.15378. The percent increase of “docper” for a one-unit increase in “bedp1000”, controlling for the other variables in the model.
* $\hat\beta_{3}$ = 0.01711. The percent increase of “docper” for a one-unit increase in “hsgrad”, controlling for the other variables in the model.
* $\hat\beta_{4}$ = 0.04025. The percent increase of “docper” for a one-unit increase in “poverty”, controlling for the other variables in the model.
* $\hat\beta_{5}$ = -0.02622. The percent decrease of “docper” for a one-unit increase in “unemp”, controlling for the other variables in the model.
* $\hat\beta_{6}$ = 0.06515. The percent increase of “docper” for a one-unit increase in “pcinck”, controlling for the other variables in the model.
